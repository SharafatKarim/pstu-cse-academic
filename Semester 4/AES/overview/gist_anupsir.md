## Economics
### Definition
*   Comes from the Greek word Oikonomia, meaning household management.
*   Adam Smith defined it as a body of knowledge related to wealth and the study of the nature and causes of the generation of a nation's wealth.
*   L. Robbins defined it as the science that studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.
*   Can be described as the branch of science that deals with the production, consumption, and distribution of wealth.

### Subject matter
#### Micro economics
*   Derived from the Greek word Micros, meaning small or little.
*   Deals with the analysis of small individual units of the economy such as buyers, sellers, individual farms, industrial units, or a group of enterprises.
*   According to Boulding, it is the study of particular firms, particular households, individual prices, wages, incomes, individual industries, and particular commodities.
#### Macro economics
*   Derived from the Greek word Makros, meaning large or total.
*   Deals with economic activities in the large or in totality.
*   According to Boulding, it deals not with individual incomes but with national income, not with individual prices but with the price level, and not with individual output but with national output.
*   Concerned with the economic activity as a whole.
*   Examples include total national product, income and employment generation, consumption, and price level of the whole economy.
*   According to Samuelson, it is the study of the behavior of the economy as a whole and examines the overall level of a nation’s output, employment, and prices.

### Method used in Economics
*   Employs scientific methods of acquiring and disseminating knowledge.
*   Utilizes observation and experimentation, although there are differences from natural sciences.
#### Deductive Method
*   A method of drawing a specific conclusion from a general statement.
*   Example: Man is mortal (general), Rahim is a man, therefore Rahim will die (specific conclusion).
#### Inductive Method
*   A method of drawing a general conclusion from some specific cases.
*   Example: Surveying a representative sample of BBA students to draw a conclusion about the English proficiency of all Business students of PSTU.

### Positive and Normative Economics
#### Positive Economics
*   Explains what is.
*   Deals with facts and can be verified (though sometimes difficult or costly).
*   Examples: Estimating the population size of Bangladesh or the total number of students in a university.
#### Normative Economics
*   Explains what ought to be.
*   Involves value judgments, suggestions, and policy recommendations.
*   Examples: Determining the optimum population size for Bangladesh or the ideal number of students for a university, considering various factors like resource availability.

### Some basic concepts in Economics
#### Utility
*   Capacity of satisfying needs/wants.
*   Subjective and can differ from person to person.
*   Not to be confused with pleasure or usefulness; it's the subjective satisfaction from consuming goods or services.
*   Utility of value is neutral.
*   **Types of utility:**
    1.  **Time utility:** Increasing value by making goods available at a different time (e.g., storing winter vegetables for summer).
    2.  **Form utility:** Increasing value by changing the form of a good (e.g., making furniture from wood).
    3.  **Place utility:** Increasing value by making goods available in a different location (e.g., branded shirts, regional specialties).
    4.  **Service utility:** Satisfaction derived from services (e.g., teacher or doctor services).
    5.  **Information utility:** Value derived from knowing about a product (existence, use, price, availability).
*   **Total Utility (TU):** Total satisfaction obtained from consuming all units of a particular commodity over time. It is the sum of marginal utilities.
*   **Marginal Utility (MU):** Additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a commodity. MU = ∆TU/∆Q. Marginal utility diminishes as more units are consumed. Total utility is maximum when marginal utility is zero (satiety point). Marginal utility can become negative, causing total utility to decline.
*   **Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility:** As a consumer consumes more and more units of a specific commodity, the utility from successive units goes on diminishing.
#### Production
*   Creation of utility with exchange value.
*   Requires both utility creation and exchange value (marketability).
*   **Factors of Production:** Land, Labor, Capital, and Organization.
#### Consumption
*   Destroying the utility through proper use.
*   Requires both utility destruction and destruction through proper use.
#### Distribution
*   Sharing of wealth among the agents or owners of the factors of production active in its production (rent for land, wage for labor, interest for capital, profit for organization).
#### Want
*   Desire to have any material and non-material commodities.
*   **Characteristics/features of wants:**
    1.  Wants are unlimited.
    2.  A particular want is limited (can be satisfied).
    3.  Wants are complementary (e.g., sugar and tea, fuel and car).
    4.  Wants are competitive (can be satisfied by alternatives, e.g., rice or bread, tea or coffee).
*   **Classification of wants:**
    1.  **Necessary:**
        *   Necessaries for existence (e.g., minimum food, clothing).
        *   Necessaries for efficiency (e.g., nutritious food, education).
        *   Necessaries for convention (e.g., tea, cigarette).
    2.  **Comforts** (e.g., warm clothing, electric fan in a factory).
    3.  **Luxury** (e.g., expensive car, air conditioner for a student).
#### Goods
*   All material and non-material commodities that have the capacity to satisfy needs/wants.
*   **Classification:**
    1.  **Consumer's goods and producer's goods:**
        *   Consumer's goods: Directly consumed (e.g., rice, bread, pen, computer).
        *   Producer's goods: Used in the production process (e.g., fertilizer, raw materials, pesticide).
    2.  **Private goods and public goods:**
        *   Private goods: Owned by individuals (e.g., chair, table, computer, pen).
        *   Public goods: Usually owned by the government, non-excludable (e.g., road, street lamp).
    3.  **Free goods and economic goods:**
        *   Free goods: Supply greater than demand, no payment needed (e.g., river water, sea water, atmospheric air).
        *   Economic goods: Supply less than demand, payment needed (e.g., mineral water, government-supplied water, cylinder oxygen).
    4.  **Material goods and non-material goods:**
        *   Material goods: Tangible, can be touched and seen (e.g., chair, table, computer, pen).
        *   Non-material goods: Intangible, can be felt (e.g., sunshine, moonlight).
    5.  **Transferable goods and non-transferable goods:**
        *   Transferable goods: Ownership can be transferred (e.g., chair, table, pen, computer).
        *   Non-transferable goods: Cannot be physically transferred (e.g., good health).
#### Wealth
*   All economic goods that have utility, scarcity (demand > supply), transferability, and externality (external existence).
*   **Classification of wealth:**
    1.  Individual wealth (owned by an individual, e.g., pen, computer).
    2.  Collective wealth (owned by more than one individual, e.g., private road, jointly owned school).
    3.  National wealth (summation of individual and collective wealth).
    4.  International wealth (e.g., sea, oceans, mountains).
#### Assumptions, Hypotheses, Theory, and Law
*   **Assumptions:** Considered true and never questioned (e.g., a one kg weight in a shop).
*   **Hypotheses:** Considered true but need to be tested (whether true or false).
*   **Theory:** A hypothesis that has been proven true for a long time (e.g., Malthusian theory of population).
*   **Law:** A hypothesis that has been proven true forever (e.g., Law of demand).
#### Firm
*   Accumulation of all producing units producing the same commodity under single ownership (e.g., Kabir poultry firm).
#### Industry
*   Accumulation of all producing units producing the same commodity under different ownership (e.g., Bangladesh poultry industry).
#### Value and Price
*   **Value:** Exchange of one commodity with another (e.g., one pen for three other pens).
*   **Price:** Value expressed in terms of money (e.g., a pen costs 10 Tk).
#### Equilibrium and its types
*   State of balance from which no deviation is desired.
*   **Types:**
    1.  Stable equilibrium (regains equilibrium after a temporary external force).
    2.  Unstable equilibrium (once distorted, never regains original equilibrium).
    3.  Neutral equilibrium (shifts to a new equilibrium position after distortion).
#### Income, Savings, and Investment
*   **Income:** Flow of all wages, interest, and other receipts accruing to an individual.
*   **Savings:** Difference between disposable income and expenditure.
*   **Investment:** Net addition to the stock of capital at the end of the year over that at the beginning.

### Demand
#### Definition of Demand
*   A desire to possess a good supported by **willingness and ability to pay** for it.
*   An **effective desire** backed by the means to purchase.
*   According to Prof. Hibdon, "Demand means the various quantities of goods that would be purchased per time period at different prices in a given market".
*   **Three main characteristics:**
    1.  Willingness and ability to pay.
    2.  Always at a price (meaningless without reference to price).
    3.  Always per unit of time.
*   Can also be described as a schedule of how much of a good people will purchase at any price during a specified period.
*   **Types of demand:**
    *   Price demand: Quantity bought at various prices, other things constant.
    *   Income demand: Quantity bought at various income levels, other things constant.
    *   Cross demand: Quantity bought in response to changes in the price of related goods, other things constant (substitutes or complements).
#### Law of Demand
*   There is an **inverse relationship** between the price of a product and the quantity demanded, other things remaining the same (ceteris paribus).
*   People buy more at lower prices and less at higher prices.
*   Quantity demanded increases with a fall in price and decreases with a rise in price.
*   Functional relationship: Qdx = f (Px, M, Po, T,..........) or Qdx = f (Px) ceteris paribus.
#### Demand Schedule
*   A list or table showing different amounts of a commodity purchased at different prices per unit of time.
#### Demand Curve
*   A **graphical representation** of the demand schedule, showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded.
*   Slopes **downward from left to right**, indicating the inverse relationship between price and quantity.
#### Assumptions of the Law of Demand
*   No change in the tastes of consumers (T).
*   Purchasing power of the typical consumer remains constant (M).
*   The price of all other commodities should not vary (Po).
#### Exceptions to the Law of Demand
*   Prestige goods (demand might increase with price).
*   Price expectations (if further price rise is expected, demand might increase at a higher price).
*   Ignorance of the consumer (may buy more at a higher price unknowingly).
*   Giffen goods (demand falls when price falls, as consumers shift to superior goods).
#### Importance of the Law of Demand
*   Helps traders in **price determination**.
*   Important for the **Finance Minister** in taxation policies.
*   Impacts **farmers** based on crop yield and demand elasticity.
#### Individual's Demand for a Commodity
*   The amount a consumer is willing to purchase at a given price over a specified time.
*   Varies inversely with price (ceteris paribus).
*   Represented by an individual demand schedule and an individual demand curve (downward sloping).
#### Market Demand for a Commodity
*   The **horizontal summation** of the total quantity demanded by all individuals at various prices over a specified time in the market.
*   Market demand schedule and market demand curve (also downward sloping).
#### Determinants of Demand
*   Changes in population (increase in population generally increases demand).
*   Changes in tastes and preferences (can shift the demand curve).
*   Changes in income (increase in income can increase demand for normal goods and decrease for inferior goods).
*   Changes in the price of substitutes (rise in price of a substitute can increase demand for the good).
*   Changes in the distribution of income (more equal distribution can increase demand for necessary goods).
*   Seasonality (demand for certain goods changes with the season).
*   Changes in savings (higher propensity to save might reduce demand).
*   Asset preferences (preference for assets over saving can increase demand for goods).
*   Trade cycle (demand fluctuates with economic booms and slumps).
*   Fashion (changes in fashion affect demand for related goods).
#### Demand Curve is Negatively Sloped
*   Due to the **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded.
*   **Fundamental reasons:**
    1.  Law of diminishing marginal utility (consumers will buy more only at a lower price as MU falls).
    2.  Income effect (fall in price increases real income, allowing more purchase).
    3.  Substitution effect (fall in price makes the good relatively cheaper, leading to substitution).
    4.  Entry of new buyers (lower prices attract new customers).
#### Contraction and Extension in Demand
*   **Contraction in demand:** Fall in quantity demanded due **only** to a rise in price (movement along the demand curve).
*   **Extension in demand:** Rise in quantity demanded due **only** to a fall in price (movement along the demand curve).
#### Decrease and Increase in Demand
*   **Decrease in demand:** Fall in quantity demanded due to changes in **any factor other than price** (shift of the demand curve to the left).
*   **Increase in demand:** Rise in quantity demanded due to changes in **any factor other than price** (shift of the demand curve to the right).

### Supply
#### Definition of Supply
*   Scarce goods that sellers are able and willing to offer for sale at different prices per unit of time.
*   Meyer defined it as a schedule of the amount of a good offered for sale at all possible prices at any period of time.
#### Law of Supply
*   There is a **direct relationship** between the price of a commodity and its quantity offered for sale, other things remaining the same.
*   Higher prices lead to increased quantity supplied, and lower prices lead to decreased quantity supplied.
#### Supply Function
*   Shows the relationship between the quantity supplied of a commodity and its determinants.
*   Formula: QxS = Φ (Px, Tech, Si, Fn, X,........).
#### Assumptions of Law of Supply
*   Nature of goods (perishable goods might be sold at current prices).
*   Government policies (enforcing sales at prevailing prices).
*   Availability of alternative products (producers might shift production).
*   Squeeze in profit (increased production costs might limit supply at higher prices).
#### Limitations/Exceptions of Law of Supply
*   Ability to move stock.
*   Legislation restricting quantity.
*   External factors influencing the industry.
#### Importance of Law of Supply
*   Supply responds differently to price changes based on elasticity (elastic vs. inelastic goods).
*   Fundamental principle showing the direct price-quantity relationship.
*   Producer's willingness to supply depends on profit incentive exceeding the opportunity cost.
*   Supplier profits depend on consumer demands and values.
#### Determinants of Supply
*   Changes in factor prices (increase in cost of production reduces supply).
*   Changes in technique (improved technology can increase supply by reducing costs).
*   Improvement in the means of transport (faster and cheaper transport can increase supply).
*   Climatic changes in case of agricultural products (favorable conditions increase supply).
*   Political changes (disturbances can disorganize production and decrease supply).
*   Taxation policy (heavy taxes reduce supply; low taxes and import encouragement increase supply).
*   Goals of firms (expectation of higher profits can lead to increased production and supply).
*   Agreement among producers (can consciously decrease supply to raise prices).
*   Number of sellers (more sellers increase supply; fewer sellers decrease supply).
*   Sellers' price expectation (expectation of future price rise can reduce current supply).
*   Trade policy (free trade might increase supply; protectionism might reduce it).
#### Contraction and Extension in Supply
*   **Contraction in supply:** Fall in supply due **only** to a fall in price (movement along the supply curve).
*   **Extension in supply:** Rise in supply due **only** to a rise in price (movement along the supply curve).
#### Decrease and increase in Supply
*   **Decrease in supply:** Fall in supply due to changes in **any factor other than price** (shift of the supply curve to the left).
*   **Increase in supply:** Rise in supply due to changes in **any factor other than price** (shift of the supply curve to the right).

### Elasticity
#### Price Elasticity of Demand
*   Measures the **responsiveness** of quantity demanded to a change in price.
*   Defined as the ratio of proportionate change in quantity demanded to a proportionate change in price.
*   Formula: Ed = (% Change in Q) / (% Change in P) = (∆Q/Q) / (∆P/P) = (∆Q/∆P) * (P/Q).
*   Example calculation provided.
*   **Types:**
    *   Elastic (|Ed| > 1): Quantity change is greater than price change; total revenue moves inversely with price.
    *   Unitary Elastic (|Ed| = 1): Quantity change equals price change; total revenue remains unchanged.
    *   Inelastic (|Ed| < 1): Quantity change is less than price change; total revenue moves in the same direction as price.
*   **Factors Determining Price Elasticity of Demand:**
    *   Nature of commodities (necessities are generally inelastic; luxuries are elastic).
    *   Availability of substitutes (more substitutes mean more elastic demand).
    *   Proportion of income spent on the good (small proportion leads to inelastic demand).
    *   Time period (demand is more elastic in the long run).
    *   Number of uses of a good (more uses mean more elastic demand).
    *   Addiction (demand for addictive goods is less elastic).
    *   Joint demand (elasticity depends on the elasticity of the jointly demanded good).
*   **Importance of Elasticity of Demand:**
    *   **Theoretical Importance:** Useful in the theory of value.
    *   **Practical Importance:**
        *   Taxation policy (higher taxes on inelastic goods yield more revenue).
        *   Price discrimination by monopolist (higher prices for inelastic demand, lower for elastic).
        *   Price discrimination in cases of joint supply.
        *   Importance to businessmen (pricing strategies based on elasticity).
        *   Help to trade unions (wage negotiation based on product demand elasticity).
        *   Use in international trade (terms of trade based on demand elasticity).
        *   Determination of rate of foreign exchange (influenced by elasticity of imports and exports).
        *   Guideline to producers (advertising expenditure based on elasticity).
        *   Use in factor pricing (inelastic demand factors can command higher prices).
#### Income Elasticity of Demand
*   Measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in consumer income.
*   Defined as the ratio of percentage change in quantity demanded to a percentage change in income.
*   Formula: Ey = (% Change in Q) / (% Change in Y) = (∆Q/∆Y) * (Y/Q).
*   Example calculation provided.
*   **Types:**
    *   For normal goods, Ey > 0 (quantity demanded increases with income).
    *   For inferior goods, Ey < 0 (quantity demanded decreases with income).
    *   Goods with 0 < Ey < 1 (income inelastic normal goods, e.g., food).
#### Cross Elasticity of Demand
*   Measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another related good.
*   Defined as the percentage change in the demand of one good as a result of the percentage change in the price of another good.
*   Formula: Exy = (% Change in Qx) / (% Change in Py).
*   **Types and Examples:**
    *   Substitute Goods (Exy > 0): Increase in price of one leads to increase in demand for the other (e.g., Coca-Cola and Pepsi).
    *   Complementary Goods (Exy < 0): Increase in price of one leads to decrease in demand for the other (e.g., car and petrol).
    *   Unrelated Goods (Exy = 0): Change in price of one has no effect on the demand for the other (e.g., apples and pens).
#### Price Elasticity of Supply
*   Measures how responsive producers are to a change in the price of a good.
*   Defined as a measure of the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price.
*   Formula: Es = (% Change in QS) / (% Change in P) = (∆QS/QS) / (∆P/P) = (∆QS/∆P) * (P/QS).
*   Supply can be elastic or inelastic.
*   **Categories/Types:**
    *   Infinitely Elastic Supply (Es = ∞): Horizontal supply curve at the ruling price.
    *   Elastic Supply (Es > 1): Percentage change in quantity supplied is greater than the percentage change in price.
    *   Unitary Elasticity (Es = 1): Percentage change in quantity supplied equals the percentage change in price.
    *   Inelastic Supply (Es < 1): Percentage change in quantity supplied is less than the percentage change in price.
    *   Perfectly Inelastic Supply (Es = 0): Vertical supply curve; quantity supplied does not change with price.
*   **Determinants/Factors of Price Elasticity of Supply:**
    *   Time period (supply is more elastic in the long run).
    *   Ability to store output (storable goods have more elastic supply).
    *   Factor mobility (higher mobility leads to greater elasticity).
    *   Changes in marginal cost of production (increasing marginal cost reduces elasticity).
    *   Excess supply/capacity (excess capacity leads to more elastic supply).
    *   Availability of infrastructure facilities (better infrastructure increases elasticity).
    *   Agricultural or industrial products (agricultural supply tends to be more inelastic).

### Theory of Consumer Behavior
#### Utility Approach
*   Explores economic forces behind consumer purchases based on satisfaction (utility).
*   Human wants are unlimited, have different intensities, and resources are scarce with alternative uses, leading to consumer choices.
*   **Cardinal Utility Analysis/Approach:**
    *   Assumes utility can be measured in cardinal numbers.
    *   **Assumptions:**
        1.  Rationality: Consumers aim to maximize satisfaction with limited income.
        2.  Cardinal measurability of utility.
        3.  Constant marginal utility of money.
        4.  Diminishing marginal utility.
        5.  Utilities of different commodities are independent and additive.
        6.  Consumption is continuous.
        7.  Suitable quantity of goods consumed.
        8.  No change in consumer character, fashion, customs, tastes, and the price of the commodity.
    *   **Criticism:** Pareto, Hicks, and Allen argued utility is ordinally comparable, not cardinally measurable, leading to the indifference curve technique.
*   **Law of Equi-Marginal Utility:**
    *   Extension of the law of diminishing marginal utility to multiple commodities.
    *   Other names: Law of Substitution, Law of Maximum Satisfaction, Law of Indifference, Proportion Rule, Gossen's Second Law.
    *   Consumers maximize utility by allocating expenditure such that the utility of the last penny spent on each item is equal.
    *   Equilibrium condition: MUx/Px = MUy/Py = ... = MUn/Pn.
    *   **Assumptions:**
        1.  Independent utilities.
        2.  Constant marginal utility of money.
        3.  Cardinal measurability of utility.
        4.  Rational consumer behavior.
    *   **Limitations:** Effects of fashions and customs, ignorance or carelessness, indivisible units, lack of perfect freedom of choice.
    *   **Importance:** Application in consumption, production (substitution of factors), distribution, and government economic policies.
*   **Derivation of the Demand Curve in Terms of Utility Analysis:**
    *   Alfred Marshall derived the law of demand and the demand curve from utility analysis.
    *   **Assumptions:** Cardinal utility, independent utilities, constant marginal utility of money, diminishing marginal utility.
    *   **Single Commodity:** Consumers demand more of a commodity only at a diminishing price because marginal utility diminishes (MUx = Px at equilibrium). This leads to a downward-sloping demand curve.
    *   **Two or More Commodities:** Consumers allocate income to maximize satisfaction where marginal utilities are proportional to prices (MUx/Px = MUy/Py = ...). A decrease in the price of one commodity (e.g., X) leads to an increase in its quantity demanded to restore equilibrium, resulting in a downward-sloping demand curve.
