SQL Judge

A MySQL database for authentication, problem set and corresponding answers. My strategy is to let the users of my application run their own command and test it against some predefined results. So that we can host competitions on database problem.

HTML = markdown
CSS = style sheet
JS = front end logic
PHP = backend requests
MySQL = database integration
