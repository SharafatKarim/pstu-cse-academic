# The final commit (DLD)

This is the files, which we designed during our final examination. 
It was a hell of a task to implement 4 D-Flip Flop with Nand gates,
cause our D flip flop (7474) wasn't working somehow. However, 
we achieved our goals with NAND (7400) and it was awesome!

Special thanks to *Afridi Alom* for managing the wires.
