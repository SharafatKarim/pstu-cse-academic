Technology
As for technology, I may use flutter + supabase (for backend)

In my app I want to let users create or organize bookmarks with nested folders.
Users can have both android, ios, web or browser extension (to be added later) for accessing and adding their contents.

There will be five sections,
- Bookmarks
- Articles
- RSS
- Explore
- Profile

First build features,
- Anonymous mode
- Optional cloud sync
- View history
- Duplicate URLs remover
- Powerful search

Future roadmapped fetures,
- Shorten URLs
- Generate QR links
- Import/ Export
- Share folders access
- Share bookmarks
- Tagging
